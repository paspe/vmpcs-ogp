\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{ch:chapter5}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Better \ac{ACL} storing and lookup algorithm \textbf{Done}
	\item Multiprocess applications? Seems like I get sometimes different process base.
	\item Multithreadded applications. 
	\item Extend plugin to monitor file execution too. Can be done by trapping \codeft{sys\_execve()} and reading the filename of the program. I think that it is always passed as absolute path, so it should be relatively easy to implement. Syscall number is weird. Needs to check for \emph{both execute and read permissions}.
	\item Implement on the fly \ac{SACL} updates. 
	\item Modify code as necessary to work in multi-CPU \acp{VM}. Maybe it works?
	\item Add \codeft{readlink()} to prevent reading of other files? Is it necessary?
	\item Check destroy of \codeft{hash-tables}.
	\item Refinement of what files and folders should be in the \ac{SACL}. Some, due to group privileges might pose a hindrance to usability. Better leave these out, or even better, just be more precise of what is in. Or we can add the corresponding permission to the OTHER.
