\begin{itemize}
	\item Better \ac{ACL} storing and lookup algorithm 
	\item Multiprocess applications. Seems like I get sometimes different process base.
	\item Multithreadded applications. 
	\item Extend plugin to monitor file execution too. Can be done by trapping sys\_execve and reading the filename of the program. I think that it is always passed as absolute path, so it should be relatively easy to implement.
	\item Implement on the fly \ac{SACL} updates. 
	\item Modify code as necessary to work in multi-CPU \acp{VM}.
\end{itemize}
