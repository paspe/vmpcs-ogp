This is an example bib file, that flexes most of the capabilities
of the .bst file. These examples are taken from the example .bib
from the IEEEtran package:

If you do not reference a bibliographic entry in your thesis,
it will not be put into your references. Thus, you may keep these
example entries in your file for reference. Of, you may delete everything
between the "START" and "END" comments, and start a fresh bib file.
