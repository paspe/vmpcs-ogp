\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

This chapter presents information about the relevant software and hardware. The first section gives a short introduction on virtualization and its benefits; it then describes the Xen hypervisor. The next section overviews the LibVMI \ac{API} and DRAKVUF, the library and main application we will leverage, as well as the system call functionality and convention. Finally, we review some of the existing solutions that leverage introspection.

\section{Virtualization}\label{sec:virtualization}
As mentioned in Rosenblum and Garfinkel~\cite{rosenblum2005virtual}, running multiple and/or different services on a single \ac{OS} is an implementation method that vendors are abandoning. In recent years, advances in computing have enabled users to run a plethora of different software, which became a challenge to manage efficiently and securely because each service required their own specific \ac{OS} configuration. Over time, hardware became inexpensive and service providers preferred to run one service per physical system to achieve higher security, since each \ac{OS} could now be configured specifically for the one service it was dedicated to running. On the downside, running one service per physical machine resulted in the under-utilization of hardware and capabilities, as well as increased maintenance costs. However, as observed by Rosenblum and Garfinkel~\cite{rosenblum2005virtual}, hosting different \ac{VM}s on a single and powerful system (Fig.~\ref{fig:tovirt}) solved many of the problems. \ac{VM}s result in resources being used efficiently, with each service using only a part of the underlying hardware. \acp{VM} also allow easier security implementation, as it is much simpler securing one \ac{VM} running one service than having to combine all of them into one. Additionally, virtualization achieves redundancy between services since each \ac{VM} is independent of the rest; any one failure does not affect the other \ac{VM}s.

\par The advantages of virtualization do not stop there: easy backup, restore, cloning, and system migration are just a few of them. In case of corruption or misconfiguration, creating snapshots of entire machines and restoration to a previous state has become an extremely easy task. Also, modern hypervisors implement a very solid and sophisticated \ac{VM} isolation; pivoting from one \ac{VM} to another has become extremely difficult.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Evolution of software deployment from single \ac{OS} to virtualization}
	\label{fig:tovirt}
\end{figure}

Hypervisor is the software that drives the mechanism of virtualization. It runs directly on the hardware, uses a separate \ac{OS} installation, and resides outside all the guest \ac{VM}s. At the same time, since the hypervisor manages the allocation and usage of all physical resources, it can see the internal state of each \ac{VM}. 

\subsection{Hypervisor types}\label{sub:hyptypes}
Different vendors provide their solutions for virtualization. Generally, hypervisors are separated in two categories: Type-I/bare-metal hypervisors and type-II/hosted hypervisors. Figure~\ref{fig:hyptypes} shows the basic architectural difference between these two types.

\par Type-II hypervisors are applications which require a host \ac{OS} to run on\footnote{Typical type-II solutions are VMWare Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.}. These hypervisors work like any other application and the \acp{VM} run on top of them. Although the average user will find them less complicated to manage, as well as those using them for simpler applications or for use as a testing environment, type-II hypervisors perform worse than type-I, as explained below. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figs/hyptypes.tikz}
	\caption{Architectural difference between type-I and type-II hypervisors}
	\label{fig:hyptypes}
\end{figure}

\par Type-I hypervisors run directly on the hardware, managing the resources directly without the intervention of any host \ac{OS} and provide a significant performance advantage. The advantage comes from eliminating the underlying \ac{OS} of the type-II hypervisors. A type-II hypervisor must ask the host \ac{OS} every time for the resources it needs to allocate, an action that produces performance overhead. Type-I hypervisors implement the resource management on their own, since they run on a more privileged \ac{OS}, and they are actually part of it. The type-I hypervisors run at the same privilege level with the \ac{OS} and can manage the resources without asking the host \ac{OS}. Therefore, type-I hypervisors provide a more efficient resource management of the hypervisor and its hosted \acp{VM}. Type-I hypervisors are most commonly used in server deployment and enterprise solutions, where performance and efficiency are important. 

\subsection{The Xen project}\label{sub:xen}
The product of the Xen project~\cite{xen} is an open-source, type-I hypervisor. Its small footprint and limited interface to the guest make it more robust and secure. The hypervisor runs directly on top of the hardware, as depicted in Figure~\ref{img:xen}. It requires a host \ac{OS} which acts as an interface between the hypervisor and the user, as well as ``paravirtualized'' guests. This host \ac{OS} is called the control or privileged domain, also known as Dom0, and runs at a more privileged level than the rest of the \ac{VM}s. The rest of the \acp{VM} are called guest domains or DomUs and run on a lower privilege level. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figs/xen.tikz}
	\caption{Xen Hypervisor Architecture}
	\label{img:xen}
\end{figure}

\par To understand how this happens, we need to introduce another \ac{CPU} architectural feature, which provides different privilege levels for the execution of the \ac{CPU}'s instructions, depending on the nature of the program invoking them. This mechanism, called protection rings, is present on all modern \ac{CPU}s and is used by all modern \acp{OS}. Protection rings are numbered 0 to 3, with 0 being the most privileged. Usually, applications run in ring 3\footnote{also called user mode.} and the kernel and device drivers run in ring 0\footnote{also called privileged or supervisor mode.}. But, in order to allocate and manage the shared resources the hypervisor must run at a more privileged level than the guest \ac{OS}, otherwise there will be a conflict when the guest \ac{OS} and the hypervisor try to manage the same resource. Paravirtualization, a technique where \ac{OS} vendors had to modify their kernels to run on a different privilege level than 0, such as 1 or 2, was initially used to avoid that conflict between the guest \ac{OS} kernel and the hypervisor.

\par For type-I hypervisors to work more efficiently and without any guest \ac{OS} modification, \ac{CPU} manufacturers have introduced a new ring, -1, to support virtualization. Called hypervisor mode, This new ring is even more privileged than ring 0 and is employed only during hypervisor execution. This architecture is supported on newer \ac{CPU}s that employ \ac{VT}, VT-x for Intel and AMD-V for AMD processors. 

As virtualization keeps advancing, there is always the question of whether we can leverage virtualization to provide more than simply efficient sharing and usage of resources. The unique ability of the hypervisor to access the state of a \ac{VM}, at the fine grain level of \ac{CPU} registers and memory bytes, has been the center of research ever since the technology was invented.

\section{Virtual Machine Introspection}\label{sec:vmi}
In this section, we introduce a rough timeline of the \acp{API} significant for our research that were evolved around virtualization and \ac{VMI}. These include \emph{LibVMI} and the later implemented \emph{altp2m} for Xen. We also mention \emph{DRAKVUF}~\cite{lengyel2014drakvuf}, a tool that employs LibVMI and altp2m to implement a virtualization-based, agentless black-box binary analysis system. We based our solution on the DRAKVUF platform . 	

\par First introduced as a concept by Garfinkel, et al~\cite{garfinkel2003virtual}, \ac{VMI} leverages the more privileged status of the hypervisor to inspect the internal state of a \ac{VM}. The Xen hypervisor was first to include introspection methods to inspect its guest \ac{VM}s. Although these introspection methods where included in Xen, implementing introspection in a way that is secure and efficient was a significant task. To make these methods more accessible to programmers, XenAccess~\cite{payne2007secure} was implemented, as well as an \ac{API} called \emph{mem-events}. Because of strong research and security interest, introspection in Xen progressed; eventually, LibVMI~\cite{payne2011libvmi}, a library that makes the implementation and automation of introspection on the Xen hypervisor easier, was introduced. LibVMI provides access to third-party applications for part of the hypervisor's introspection methods , using a C or Python interface, the latter called PyVMI. 

\par Initially, hypervisor memory management included an extra step in the memory-access mechanism, because each \ac{VM} assumes that it has complete control over the entire address space and that it writes directly on the hardware. Normally, the \ac{OS} would translate the virtual address used by an application to a physical address on the hardware. To a hypervisor, each \ac{VM} is considered an application. Since every \ac{OS} will eventually try to write on the same physical address, the hypervisor must make a distinction between the \ac{VM}s. To achieve that distinction, the hypervisor assigns each \ac{VM} a specific physical address space and, as explained in Chisnall~\cite{chisnall2008definitive}, tracks the overall memory usage with an additional \ac{PT} translating between a \ac{VM}-specific \ac{GMFN} and the \ac{MFN}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figs/mm.tikz}
	\caption{Hypervisor memory management concept}
	\label{fig:hypmm}
\end{figure}

\par With the introduction of \ac{IOMMU}, this extra step is no longer needed because hardware \acp{EPT} were included in the \ac{CPU}s; the hypervisors can use these hardware \acp{EPT} instead of software ones, a method called \ac{HAP(1)}. \ac{HAP(1)} implemented better isolation, and enhanced security between the \acp{VM}, with significantly reduced overhead. Following that development, as well as Intel's addition of 512 \acp{EPT} in its Haswell generation \ac{CPU}, XenAccess and mem-events were redesigned and evolved into a system called \emph{altp2m}. One of the most critical changes that came with altp2m was the concurrent assignment of multiple \ac{EPT}s per \ac{VM} (Fig.~\ref{fig:ept}). Monitoring processes of multi-virtual \ac{CPU} guests is more secure and is clearly a significant improvement. Because each virtual \ac{CPU} can be assigned its own \ac{EPT} the hypervisor can now keep track of different \acp{EPT} with different permissions, which can change during the execution of the \ac{VM}. Other solutions keep only one \ac{EPT} per \ac{VM}, resulting in a less secure and isolated virtual environment between the \acp{VM} and the \acp{VM}' processes.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.95}{\input{figs/ept.tikz}}
	\caption{Normal vs altp2m multiple \ac{EPT} assignment}
	\label{fig:ept}
\end{figure}

\par LibVMI is an \ac{API} which provides exposure to a subset of Xen’s \ac{VMI} functionalities, as well as other platforms. LibVMI makes it possible to monitor the state of any \ac{VM}, including the memory and \ac{CPU} state. Memory can be accessed directly using physical addresses, or indirectly with the use of virtual addresses, \ac{OS} symbols, and user-application symbols. It can monitor memory events, register events\footnote{such as memory read, memory write.}, register value change, and provide notifications for them. This allows the execution of callback functions, while the monitoring application resides outside the \acp{VM} and accesses the \acp{VM} through the hypervisor (Fig.~\ref{fig:libvmi}). 


\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\input{figs/libvmi.tikz}
	\caption{LibVMI out-of-guest access of \ac{VM} state}
	\label{fig:libvmi}
\end{figure}

\par LibVMI focuses on a subset of introspection methods that provide memory reading and writing capabilities from running \ac{VM}s. It also provides methods for accessing and modifying \ac{CPU} registers, as well as helper methods to pause and unpause a \ac{VM}. Accessing a \ac{VM}'s memory space is not a trivial task. After detecting where the page directory is, a scan of the page tables follows in order to detect the memory mapping of the running process. This gets translated into a virtual address, which the hypervisor later translates into a physical address. Figure~\ref{fig:accesskernel} shows a slightly different request, reading a kernel symbol.

\par Xen’s introspection methods significantly impact system security. The monitoring application resides on the host and accesses the \ac{VM}s' state from the hypervisor, which implies a zero-footprint monitoring tool from the \ac{VM}'s perspective. The monitor does not leave a trace of its action that can be detected from inside the guest.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\input{figs/kernelsym.tikz}
%	\includegraphics{libvmi}
	\caption{Using LibVMI to access the value of a kernel symbol}
	\label{fig:accesskernel}
\end{figure}

\par Although this development was game-changing, it had its drawbacks. Just monitoring those values of specific parts of memory, or the \ac{CPU} registers, over an interval to make any inferences about the running state of the \ac{VM} leaves the \ac{VM} vulnerable during the waiting period. A solution for this is to trap the memory regions that we want to monitor for access or modification; this, however, can be detected by a knowledgeable adversary. 

\par To solve this problem, LibVMI and altp2m, along with the substantial number of \ac{EPT}s on the latest \ac{CPU}s, were were combined in DRAKVUF~\cite{lengyel2014drakvuf}, a dynamic malware analysis platform. One of DRAKVUF's most significant key features is that it traps the memory addresses the user wants to monitor for access. When an event gets triggered, the \ac{EPT} with the trapped address gets swapped with the original so that the execution of the guest \ac{VM} continues. This allows the monitoring of a number of user-determined memory addresses, providing notification and response capabilities on every such event, while at the same time being untraceable from inside the guest.


\section{System Calls}\label{sec:syscalls}
Modern \ac{OS}s are responsible for allocating their resources efficiently and securely for themselves, as well as to the user level applications. The part of the \ac{OS} assigned to manage these resources - like memory, hard disk drive access, or \ac{CPU} time - is the kernel of the \ac{OS}. The kernel, which runs in its own space, is the heart of the \ac{OS} that makes everything work without conflicts; it also resolves any conflicts presented/created. When an application is running, it runs in the so-called ``user-space''. This distinction exists to prevent applications from having direct access to the underlying hardware and is enforced with the protection rings, as explained previously. The running application has no knowledge of any other application(s) being executed on the same machine, and whenever it requires a resource, it asks the \ac{OS} through the kernel. The kernel, on its behalf, accesses the hard disk drive, allocates memory, or executes other commands that are considered privileged and the application cannot execute. It handles all the low-level details of what the application requested and returns the results of the action. 

\par This very complicated software is the most crucial part of the \ac{OS}. Therefore, not every process can access the kernel directly or invoke all the kernel's functions in order to avoid corruption or misuse the low-level access the kernel has, i.e. to gain access where a process should not. This limited interface to the kernel, a sort of protection mechanism, is called a system call. The details of making a system call depend on the \ac{OS}.

\par Programming with a high-level language usually does not involve making system calls directly. Most languages have implemented wrappers for making a system call and simplifying the system call interface. Regardless, the application will eventually have to make a system call to access some of the system's resources. One type of resource an application needs to request access for from the \ac{OS} is files. This is performed with the \codeft{open()} system call. Access to input devices, such as a keyboard, is also requested from the \ac{OS} with the use of the \codeft{read()} system call.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

\par Whether resulting from user error or targeted malicious activity, system compromise is inevitable because of errors in the running programs. This eventuality led researchers to invest their resources in \ac{VM} security space.The Introspection concept gave birth to numerous interesting solutions that target a more critical issue of the information world, that of computer security. Some solutions focus on the analysis part by leveraging the hypervisor's introspection methods to gain better insight and understanding of the behavior and impact of a malware so that it can be successfully intercepted. Other solutions take more active roles by trying to protect crucial parts of a running \ac{VM}. They prevent the kernel from becoming corrupted or provide secure access to the parts of the memory where critical information or applications are stored. 
Each of these solutions, in their own unique ways, can provide valuable information on which events and actions led to a compromised system, or protect the vital \ac{OS} space from being corrupted by malicious activity. 
The following categories of methods of securing \ac{VM}-based systems represent only some of the solutions produced so far, and the categories were based on the work by Bauman, et al~\cite{bauman2015survey}.

\subsection{In-\ac{VM} Monitoring}\label{sub:invm}
In-\ac{VM} solutions implement part of the functionality inside the \ac{VM}. They employ an inside agent to gather information on the \ac{VM}'s execution state and use the elevated privileges of the hypervisor to protect the agent from corruption or subversion. Depending on the application, we can further refine the classification in terms of detection, prevention. There are also some recovery solutions, but we consider them outside the scope of this research. Working in a \ac{VM} to gather information for the hypervisor can become a very intensive task, resulting n increase of the performance overhead. As with every \ac{VM}, the hypervisor is a complete \ac{OS}, intercepting its own interrupts while running its processes, applications, and scheduler. There is additional performance overhead when the execution switches between a \ac{VM} and the hypervisor and vice versa. The pair of events related to hypervisor and \ac{VM} switching are called \codeft{VM-exit} and \codeft{VM-entry} (figure~\ref{fig:vmevents}). Having a monitoring and logging application on the hypervisor triggers a considerable number of VM-exit events. This is a problem some of the following solutions tried to address by using different approaches.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\input{figs/vmevents.tikz}
	\caption{VM-exit and VM-entry events}
	\label{fig:vmevents}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Detection}

The hypervisor, since it provides all the resource allocation, can mark the memory pages allocated to a \ac{VM} different, than the guest \ac{OS} would. It can mark a page read-only when the \ac{OS} marks it as read/write. This will trigger a \ac{VM}-exit event and the hypervisor can act according to a different policy than that of the \ac{VM}’s \ac{OS}. To prevent performance overhead, SIM~\cite{sharif2009secure}, a monitoring solution,  used the hypervisor in the following way: SIM is placed inside the \ac{VM}, monitoring the guest \ac{OS}, but at the same time it is protected by the hypervisor by being placed on a protected region of the \ac{VM}’s address space. 

\par Gathering information at the hypervisor level, though, presents a new problem. Each action collected has the potential for having been executed by different processes. This uncertainty makes it harder to understand the higher level action being executed; it is a semantic gap between the hypervisor and the guest \ac{VM}s. Virtuoso~\cite{dolan2011virtuoso} is a tool that tries to bridge that semantic gap by automating the process of extracting \ac{OS} kernel information relevant to introspection. By running a helper program inside the \ac{VM}, which yields the wanted result(s), it analyzes the execution trace of that helper program and generates the introspection code that will give the same result when executed from the hypervisor. This method helps gain some knowledge about the machine's internal state from the hypervisor’s point of view without requiring the intricate knowledge of the \ac{OS}. 

\subsubsection{Prevention}

Lares~\cite{payne2008lares}, in the same manner, tried to modify the guest \ac{OS} minimally so that the code used for monitoring could be protected easily, while all the introspection and decision making code was placed in a ``security \ac{VM}''. The two communicated through the hypervisor, which protected the hooked code in the untrusted \ac{VM}, while at the same time provided information to the ``security \ac{VM}''. It also provided communication between the \ac{VM}s, so that the decision-making from the ``security \ac{VM}'' can be applied to the untrusted one. In this situation, the monitoring happens during process creation, allowing or denying the execution of programs as defined in a white-list.

\par SHype~\cite{sailer2005building} is a modified hypervisor that implements \ac{MAC} on shared resources between \ac{VM}s. SHype is used also in Hay and Nance~\cite{hay2008forensics} to provide a more fine-grained \ac{MAC} on data flow between \ac{VM}s and services. Hyperlink~\cite{xiao2016hyperlink} implements a hybrid of protected in-\ac{VM} monitoring and \ac{MAC}-based hypervisor protection for guest \ac{VM} and hypervisor protection.

\par InkTag~\cite{hofmann2013inktag} introduces many different new concepts to run a \ac{HAP(2)} on an untrusted \ac{OS}. The threat model for this approach is more advanced and sophisticated: Inktag, to protect the \ac{HAP(2)}, employs many different mechanisms on various levels to ensure that there is no data leak or malicious intervention during the \ac{HAP(2)}'s runtime. 

\par Inktag also introduces ``paraverification''~\cite{hofmann2013inktag}, in which the kernel is required to perform some extra tasks to provide the hypervisor high-level information about the process state. This way, the hypervisor can easily determine the high-level effects of low-level actions. Furthermore, the \ac{HAP(2)} does not interact directly with the kernel; this is done by an untrusted trampoline code, which is responsible for making the system calls instead of the \ac{HAP(2)}. Upon receiving the system call results from the \ac{OS} and validating them, the untrusted code returns them to the \ac{HAP(2)}.

\par To protect the contents of the \ac{HAP(2)}s' memory address space, InkTag employs two \acp{EPT}: one for use during untrusted execution, which is visible by the untrusted \ac{OS}, and one for use during trusted execution, which is only visible to and used by the hypervisor. In addition, if a page from the \ac{HAP(2)}'s address space needs to be evicted, InkTag hashes the contents and encrypts them before they get written on the disk. This way, it provides protection against malicious modification and access.
Also, to further protect the \ac{HAP(2)} and its files, a different access control mechanism is used: each process and file is followed by attributes which are used to enforce access policies. These will protect the files, the processes, and their spawned processes. To address memory and files, InkTag also uses a different convention; the use of \ac{OI}, an internal representation visible and known only to the \ac{HAP(2)} and the hypervisor. These are used to define the permissions available to each \ac{HAP(2)}.
Finally, to provide crash consistency InkTag modifies the actual media layout, by injecting file metadata. These metadata are not visible by the untrusted \ac{OS}, since these sectors are not included in the media view of the \ac{OS}. 

\par Although InkTag provides many assurances for the secure execution of a \ac{HAP(2)}, the need to re-compile applications so that they can run securely, poses a significant drawback and compromise of usability.

\par Using a similar approach, Overshadow~\cite{chen2008overshadow} provides a one-to-many memory mapping from the \ac{VM} to physical memory, as well as other mechanisms to further protect the applications and their data. The actual data in memory depend on the process(es) trying to access them. The contents get encrypted and hashed for untrusted processes and decrypted when a trusted application tries to access them. 

\par To manage a secure application execution inside a compromised \ac{OS}, Haven~\cite{baumann2015shielding} takes a different approach. To protect the application, Haven employs Intel's \ac{SGX}. \ac{SGX} allow a process to define a secure region of an address space, called an enclave. Haven puts the whole application in an enclave and uses an in-enclave library \ac{OS} for the interactions with the \ac{OS}.

\par Unfortunately, these solutions are not foolproof. InkTag and Haven were attacked in Xu, et al~\cite{xu2015controlled} with the use of controlled-channel attacks, resulting to the extraction of substantial amounts of sensitive information from protected applications. Complete text documents were extracted, as well as outlines of JPEG images, showing that data protection during process is not an insignificant task. 


\subsection{Out-\ac{VM} Monitoring}\label{sub:outvm}
Having a monitoring tool completely on the hypervisor has its benefits, but is also a significant drawback. Although everything is visible from the hypervisor's perspective, it is extremely difficult to understand the context of the data collected by analyzing memory and \ac{CPU} register values during every execution cycle, a semantic gap that needs to be filled. This section will present some of the out-\ac{VM} solutions: some work on raw collected data, while others try to bridge the semantic gap to better understand the high-level commands being executed in the \ac{VM}.

\subsubsection{Detection}

\par ReVirt~\cite{dunlap2002revirt} is a logging application, that uses the hypervisor’s \ac{VM} access to create extensive logs of a \ac{VM}’s execution. Since the hypervisor has unlimited access to the state of the \ac{VM}, ReVirt can collect and record enough information to be able to recreate and simulate the execution of the target machine. This can be very valuable for collecting malware activity data even after the system has been compromised, hijacked, or even replaced. The replay data can prove very useful in the malware analysis field, as every non-deterministic action of a malware is recorded and deterministic results can be recreated, providing a full view of the system and the malware's impact at every step of the malicious activity.

\par From the moment the \ac{VM} starts booting, the solution in Macko, et al~\cite{macko2011collecting} uses the ability of the hypervisor to transparently access the running \ac{VM}’s internal state to collect system-level provenance. 

\par Using a different approach, Crawford and Peterson~\cite{crawford2013insider} implemented a mechanism to detect insider threats, using \ac{VMI} to stealthily monitor the users' actions and detect suspicious activity that correlates to an insider threat. Although this alert mechanism is very useful, especially due to its transparency, the attacker still gets access to the information sought after.

\par When the introspection idea was conceived by Garfinkel, et al~\cite{garfinkel2003virtual}, it was utilized to create a hybrid \ac{IDS}. The \ac{IDS} solution combined the best of both worlds, \ac{HIDS} and \ac{NIDS}, by being placed on the hypervisor. Since it is placed outside the \ac{VM}, it has the advantage of not being prone to detection, attack and corruption, or evasion. It can directly monitor the network traffic, given that the \ac{NIC} is a common shared resource. On the other hand, by having the hypervisor’s introspection capability, it can act also as a \ac{HIDS} by monitoring the actual system behavior and execution. 

\par Other solutions, like Strider Ghostbuster~\cite{wang2005detecting}, PoKeR~\cite{riley2009multi} and VMWatcher~\cite{jiang2007stealthy}, have been proposed to fill the semantic gap between the hypervisor and the guest \ac{VM} . All of them employ different techniques, but unfortunately, as later researchers like Mahapatra and Selvakumar~\cite{mahapatra2011online} mention, they all fail at some point because this semantic gap is difficult to bridge. 

\subsubsection{Prevention}

\par This semantic gap was also addressed in Srinivasan, et al~\cite{srinivasan2011process} with a technique called process out-grafting. Instead of monitoring the \ac{VM} as a whole, this method focuses on each separate process for a more fine-grained execution monitoring and is done by implementing two new techniques. The first is called on-demand grafting, which can relocate a running process from the guest target \ac{VM} to a security \ac{VM}. This effectively bridges the semantic gap, as, for all intents and purposes, the process is running on the same system as the monitor. This way, the monitor can intercept all instructions executed by the suspicious process without the need of hypervisor intervention. The second technique, called split execution, makes a logical separation on the execution of instructions. If the process runs in user-space, it continues to run on the security \ac{VM}. When there is a kernel request, like a system-call, it executes that instruction on the target \ac{VM}. Since they do not run on the same kernel, this technique isolates the monitor from the suspicious process; it is still running inside the target \ac{VM}, from the suspect’s process perspective. 

\par Furthermore, SecVisor~\cite{seshadri2007secvisor} and HUKO~\cite{xiong2011practical} proposed a kernel integrity method that protects the kernel against rootkit code injection. In this case, SecVisor and HUKO are part of the hypervisor. They permit user-allowed code execution, while at the same time preventing malicious code execution.


\par Sentry~\cite{srivastava2012efficient} does a more granular kernel protection by preventing low-trust kernel components from altering security-critical data used by the kernel to manage itself and the system. It protects dynamically allocated memory, is isolated from the untrusted kernel by running on the Hypervisor, and reduces the overhead by monitoring only the kernel related memory pages for suspicious activity.


\par Paladin~\cite{baliga2008automated} first introduced the concept of an Out-of-Guest \ac{ACL}. The \acp{ACL} in this case have a rule-based system that marks whole folders or files with generic permissions. In this case, generic permissions means that they affect all users and groups in the same way; there is no user or group-specific ruling and all file accesses fall in the same category. Therefore, Paladin provides its file security at a coarser level than the one desired. Additionally, it uses an in-guest module which, although relatively small and protected, still runs in the guest \ac{VM}. Also, as stated in Baliga, et al\cite{baliga2008automated}, this \ac{ACL} implementation introduces many usability problems, like trying to upgrade running applications. To perform such an action the system must be taken offline, its \ac{ACL} rules must be changed to perform the upgrade, and then the system's online presence must be restored. 

\par A more direct approach to file integrity was presented in~\cite{nasab2012security} with Nasab trying to protect the \ac{OS} from accessing maliciously modified files. The target \ac{VM} is deployed offline and all the files are signed digitally using a private key; the digests are then stored on the hypervisor. When the process has been completed for all the files to be protected, the \ac{VM} returns to online status. During its execution, whenever a file is accessed but before it gets loaded into memory, the system retrieves its digest and compares it to the copy on the hypervisor. If the file has not changed, access or execution continues; otherwise access or execution is denied.

\par As best as we could determine, all work on \ac{VM} monitoring and security focuses on kernel and \ac{OS} protection, malicious activity monitoring, extensive logging for replay and online or offline forensic purposes, and/or secure resource-sharing among \ac{VM}s. Only Paladin \cite{baliga2008automated} provides a protection for the actual files of the system. Even this solution, as mentioned before, provides a generic out-\ac{VM} \ac{ACL} approach and can introduce various usability issues. Also, it will need further development to protect against newly-created attacks which can maliciously access files when the \ac{VM} has been compromised. Furthermore, it is a in-\ac{VM} solution, as there is code of Paladin running in the guest\ac{VM}, leaving this way a footprint of its presence. \ac{VM} security is a very active research field which has produced many solutions, each with a different focus, but generally surrounding the malware protection realm, as depicted in table~\ref{tbl:overview} and even more extensively in Bauman et al \cite{bauman2015survey}\footnote{an extensive survey on hypervisor-based solutions.}.


\par Because zero-day vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and exploited, we did not want to focus on detecting specific behaviors to assess the presence of malware and methods to restrain it, since these behaviors change and evolve with the development of new attacks. We do want to focus on a more generic case where we expect the running system to be hacked and can protect files in a compromised running \ac{VM} against insider threats, rootkits, and malware in general.
